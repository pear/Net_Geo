The NetGeo server is provided by CAIDA (caida.org). If you are concerned with
with anything to do with using the NetGeo server, please check their website
(http://www.caida.org/tools/utilities/netgeo/)

localizer is available from http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/localizer/

Even though the NetGeo server will process domain names I find that success is
sporadic. Using IP addresses or AS numbers will work everytime.

 * - Added support for the HostIP service, which still retaining the same
 *   existing functionality (by default).  To use the HostIP service, simply
 *   add the setService() call as in the following example:
 *
 *   > $geo = new Net_Geo();
 *   > $geo->setService('hostip');
 *   > $geo->getRecord("php.net");
 *
 * - Fixed a number of minor bugs, specifically related to providing
 *   alternate URLs.
 *
 * - Fixed code to allow changing the current service via the setService call,
 *   without having to create a new object.
 *
 * - Added RAWDATA result array item which contains the complete returned
 *   array data.  The rest of the result array for the HostIP service is
 *   setup to match the existing CAIDA result array.
